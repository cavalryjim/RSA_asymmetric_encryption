    "## RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "RSA cryptography, named after its inventors Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm. It is a fundamental tool in modern cryptography and is used for secure data transmission, digital signatures, and various other cryptographic applications. RSA relies on the mathematical properties of prime numbers for its security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simplified explanation of how RSA cryptography works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Generation:\n",
    "- The first step is to generate a pair of keys: a public key and a private key.\n",
    "- The public key is meant to be shared with anyone who wants to send you encrypted data. It contains two components: the modulus (usually represented as 'n') and the public exponent (usually represented as 'e').\n",
    "- The private key is kept secret and should never be shared. It contains the modulus and a private exponent (usually represented as 'd').\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encryption:\n",
    "- When someone wants to send you an encrypted message, they use your public key to encrypt it.\n",
    "- The encryption process involves converting the plaintext message into a numeric value, raising it to the power of 'e', and taking the result modulo 'n'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decryption:\n",
    "- You, as the recipient, use your private key to decrypt the message.\n",
    "- The decryption process involves taking the encrypted numeric value, raising it to the power of 'd', and taking the result modulo 'n'.\n"
